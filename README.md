  <h1>Cafe Order Management System</h1>
  <p>The Cafe Order Management System is designed to simplify the process of placing and managing cafe orders. This system uses a menu (stored as a dictionary in the code with item names and prices) and enables users to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>List Menu:</strong> Display all available items with their prices.</li>
    <li><strong>Take Orders:</strong> Users can place orders by selecting items from the menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Show Prices:</strong> The system calculates the total price of the items ordered.</li>
    <li><strong>Add More Items:</strong> After each order, the system asks, "Would you like to order anything else?" If yes, it displays the menu again.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit the System:</strong> When the user enters "done", the system finalizes the order and exits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Start the System:</strong>  
      The system displays the menu, showing items and their prices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Placing an Order:</strong>  
      The user selects items from the menu and specifies quantities. The system calculates the total price and keeps adding it to the bill.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adding More Items:</strong>  
      After placing an order, the system asks:  
      <p>"Would you like to order anything else?"</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If yes, the menu is displayed again.</li>
        <li>If the user enters "done", the system finalizes the order.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Finalizing the Order:</strong>  
      Once the user is done, the system calculates and displays the final bill.
    </li>
  </ol>
